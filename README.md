**PlantGAN: An Data Augmentation Method for Practical Plant Disease Diagnosis**<br>


Abstract: *Many applications for the automated diagnosis of plant disease have been developed based on the success of deep learning techniques. However, these applications often suffer from overÔ¨Åtting, and the diagnostic performance is drastically decreased when used on test datasets from new environments. In this Github, we propose different generative AI methods (Conditional GAN, image-to-image translation models, VAEs, and Diffusion models) which generate a wide variety of diseased images via transformation from healthy images, as a data augmentation tool for improving the performance of plant disease diagnosis.*


## Datasets
- Normal dataset: A normal dataset will have 4 directories for two domains A (trainA, testA) and B (trainB, testB). Each directory must contain only images (no other file types).
An example of the dataset named `healthy2brownspot`
```bash
/path/to/healthy2brownspot/trainA
/path/to/healthy2brownspot/testA
/path/to/healthy2brownspot/trainB
/path/to/healthy2brownspot/testB
```
- Masked dataset: This dataset is normal dataset + pre-generated mask images. First, you need to generate your own mask images using the [prepare_mask.py]. An example of the masked dataset named `healthy2brownspot_mask`
```bashf
/path/to/healthy2brownspot/trainA
/path/to/healthy2brownspot/trainA_mask # mask images of trainA
/path/to/healthy2brownspot/testA
/path/to/healthy2brownspot/trainB
/path/to/healthy2brownspot/trainB_mask # mask images of trainB
/path/to/healthy2brownspot/testB
```
## cycleGAN/CycleGAN train/test
- Make sure to prepare the dataset first
- Train a model (example with the dataset `healthy2brownspot`):s
```bash
python train.py --dataroot /path/to/healthy2brownspot --name healthy2brownspot_cycleGAN --model cycle_gan
```
- Train model with mask images (example with the dataset `healthy2brownspot_mask`):
```bash
python train.py --dataroot /path/to/healthy2brownspot --name healthy2brownspot_cycleGAN --model cycle_gan --dataset_mode unaligned_masked
```
To see more intermediate results, check out `./checkpoints/healthy2brownspot_cycleGAN/web/index.html`.
- Test the model:
```bash
python test.py --dataroot /path/to/healthy2brownspot --name healthy2brownspot_cycleGAN --model cycle_gan
```
- The test results will be saved to a html file here: `./results/healthy2brownspot_cycleGAN/latest_test/index.html`.
